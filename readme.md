I'm learning Scala by creating a connect 4 game.

Game runs in Slack and Console.

Uses the slack scala client here to handle interactions with slack - https://github.com/slack-scala-client/slack-scala-client

Uses:
- AWS as the cloud provider
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- Buildkite for it's CI pipeline
- Docker for containerization
