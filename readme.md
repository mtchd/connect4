# Connect 4

I'm learning Scala by creating a connect 4 game.

Game runs in slack, with plans for discord as well.

Uses the slack scala client here to handle interactions with slack - https://github.com/slack-scala-client/slack-scala-client

## Manual Tests

- Challenge a player
- Accept a challenge
- Reject a challenge
- Forfeit a game
- Reset a game
- Drop a disc
- Check 4 in a row wins
